## Key Components and Features:

### Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

I utilized Terraform, an IaC tool, to define and provision the AWS resources required for my static website hosting solution. This allows for version-controlled, repeatable infrastructure deployments.

### AWS S3 Bucket:

I created an S3 bucket to store and serve the static website files. This bucket is configured for website hosting, allowing for easy content delivery.

### Content Upload and Management:

I provided instructions and scripts for uploading and managing my website content within the S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites:
1. Basic knowledge of AWS services and concepts.
2. Familiarity with Terraform and infrastructure as code principles.
3. An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
4. An IDE of your Choice , I would suggest VS Code Editor .
5. This project serves as an excellent foundation for hosting various types of static websites, including personal blogs, portfolio sites, or small business websites.
